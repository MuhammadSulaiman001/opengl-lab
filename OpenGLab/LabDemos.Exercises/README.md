## Notes:

Exercises in this project are designed for you to practice and get handy with the tech. You're not requested to do all of them, but I strongly recommend you do so!

## More Exercises:

### Edit `LearnOpenGL` code
The following are some exercises that you can practice on [LearnOpenGL](https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL) code (you should've cloned the repo following the instructions provided [here](./README.md)):

- `1.getting_started__1.1.hello_window`: Create 2 empty windows, `cout` log messages to console when a mouse-click occurs inside a window.
- `1.getting_started__1.2.hello_window_clear`: Create 2 empty windows, each one with different background color.
- `1.getting_started__3.3.shaders_class`: Create a second triangl, by creating another shader program
- `1.getting_started__6.1.coordinate_systems`: draw 3 separated rectangles, by passing new `model` matrix to the vertex shader.
- `1.getting_started__7.4.camera_class`: simulate a jump when the user presses `GLFW_KEY_SPACE`

NOTE: Each article at https://learnopengl.com/ comes with 1-3 exercises, I strongly recommend checking them out, trying to do these exercises by your own.

### Clone, Build and Run opensource projects

I believe that being able to build/run opensource projects is an important skill that you must get used to it, you will get too much experience with the build system, tools, libraries, coding patterns, etc... from all kind of projects (good-mid-low)!
