	// Keep master branch clean,
	// To avoid any probable conflicts that might occur when you pull new commits from remote, I recommend you
	// create new local branch and write your code on there..
	// 1. ImGUI, ImGuiFileDialog, glad, GLFW and DxfParser are linked and ready to be consumed by this application
	// 2. Refer to `OpenFileDialog` sample in 'LabDemos' project to get started with GUI code
	// 3. Refer to `DxfParserTests` tests in 'UnitTests' project to get started with pxf-Parsing
	// 4. Other samples might be useful as well (ex. `HelloPrimitives` sample in 'LabDemos')
	// 5. This app can be launched from command line (ex. PowerShell, cmd, etc...) with a "dxf path" as input, You have to take this into account
