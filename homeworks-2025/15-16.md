## Game description

When running the application, there should be a scene **exactly** like this:

![game](./../res/walking-circle.png)

Bind the circle with awesomeface.png, and the box with container.jpg (there are 3 boxes only, positioned like the image above)

Use these textures specifically:
1. [awesomeface.png](https://learnopengl.com/img/textures/awesomeface.png)
2. [container.jpg](https://learnopengl.com/img/textures/container.jpg)

## When user presses arrows' keys on keyboard

1. right arrow: moves the ball to right
2. left arrow: moves the ball to
3. up arrow: moves the ball up
4. down arrow: moves the ball down

When nothing is pressed, the ball stays in its position.

Circle can walk backward, and get back to the starting position at most.

Please, don't add any requirement by yourself, there is no gravity! no jump (e.g. space key)

Intersections between objects is not allowed, i.e. they can not cross each other.

## When the game ends?

The game ends when the ball moves beyond the scene (positive X-axis) and disappears completely (not partially).

Boxes' positions are fixed and should not move at all.

Notes:

1. Don't draw anything on the screen, not even on the console.
2. User can't restart the game.
3. User can only close the application
