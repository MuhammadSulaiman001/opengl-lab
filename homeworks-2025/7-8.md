## Game description

* When running the application, there should be an empty scene, and immediately, one box starts falling down to the ground.

![game start](./../res/fallen-box-start.png)

* User can use left/right arrows on the keyboard to move the box while the box is moving down.

* Once the box is stable, a second box will start to fall.

Use [container.jpg](https://learnopengl.com/img/textures/container.jpg) as a texture for the box.

- The width of the scene should fit 4-5 boxes next to each other.
- The height of the scene should fit 7-8 boxes on top of each other.
- You should be able to control the box dimension from the code (one global variable for the dimension of each box).
- You should be able to contol the speed of the fall from the code.
- Boxes should not intersect (i.e. not allowed to cross each other).
- User can only use left/right arrows
- User can not prevent the box movement.


### When the game ends?

Game ends when boxes cross the top of the screen (the top of the top-most box might not be visible).
