# OpenGL-Lab (2023-2024)

## Quick Start

- Please note that the following configuration is not opengl-specific, but is for almost any C++ project out there!

1. Install/Update [Visual studio 2022 - Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

![vs2022-installer-workloads](./res/vs2022-installer-workloads.png)

2. Install/Update CMake [(official site)](https://cmake.org/download/) (use the `.msi`)
3. Install/Update Git [(official site)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. Install/Update Powershell [(Microsoft Store)](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/powershell/9MZ1SNWT0N5D)
    - Or from [GitHub repo](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)
    - Needs VPN (in some countries ðŸ¤”)
5. Add CMake and Git to PATH environmental variable (at top of the list), these are the default paths
    * `C:\Program Files\CMake\bin`
    * `C:\Program Files\Git\bin`
6. Run the following commands in Powershell (one by one)

```
cmake --version # verify cmake is installed
git --version # verify git is installed
# cd path\where\you\clone\opensource\projects
git clone https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL
cd LearnOpenGL
mkdir build && cd build # create/move to build directory
cmake .. # build the build system :)
# cmake --build . # build all the projects, might take few minutes!
cmake --build . --target 1.getting_started__2.1.hello_triangle # builds only this target
cd ..\bin\1.getting_started\Debug # move to output location
.\1.getting_started__2.1.hello_triangle.exe # run the exe you've built
# explorer.exe . # open in windows explorer!
```

Now, you have built the sample and run it, without writing any C++ code or opening visual studio at all.

    - Configure the settings to: 
        - Make powershell 7.3.x the default terminal, 
        - Run as adminstrator 
        - Run at startup.
- Install/Upgrade Make using [Powershell/Choco](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
    - `choco upgrade chocolatey` # optional
    - `choco upgrade all` # optional
    - `choco list` # see all packages installed by choco
    - **`choco install make` # install make**
    - `choco upgrade make` # upgrade make

## vcxproj setup (best practices):
- In general: change project settings for all configurations (debug/release) and all platforms (x86, x64).
- Change Output/Temp directories to be created inside the project directory, for example:
    - Output Directory: `$(ProjectDir)$(Platform)\$(Configuration)`
    - Temp Directory: `$(ProjectDir)$(Platform)\$(Configuration)\Temp`
- Create `dependencies` directory at root directory (next to .sln file) to be shared for all projects
    - Create dlls/libs/headers folders inside it
- Don't use vcpkg (unless if your developing using CMake)
- Use Post-Build-Event to copy dll files and all other resources (ex. images/shaders/etc...) to output directory
    - Recommended: let the event call .ps1 script, which will run one/more commands.
    - Your app should run via .exe double click!
- Let the application encapsulates all needed resources in order to build it successfully on other machines
    - Don't put .lib files, .h/.hpp files and .dll files in common directories (outside your solution).. git should track these files.
- Don't just list .cpp/.h/etc.. files at project directory..
    - create src/headers/resources/scripts/shaders/etc.. directories, so you keep things organized as much as possible!


## Consuming libraries

Libaries can be found in different flavors, the common ones are:
- Headers only (ex. glm)
- Headers and sources (ex. glad, stb)
- Headers + Lib (ex. glfw)
- Headers + Lib + DLL (ex. assimp)

1. To tell VS where the header files are (so you can `#include <>` them), go to:
    - Project properties -> C\C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories, 
    - add a **relative path** to where these header files are.
2. To tell VS where the implementation binaries are, go to:
    - Project properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories, 
    - add a relative path to .libs files
3. Tell the linker what libs you want to consume by adding their names in:
    - Code, via `#pragma comment(lib, "lib-name.lib")` 
    - Or: from Project properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies
4. For sources (c/c++ files), just add them to your project
    - Move the source files to the project -> Solution Explorer -> Show Hidden Files -> Right click on the newly added source files -> Include In Project.
5. For dll files, go to:
    - Project properties -> Build Events -> Post-Build-Event
    - Trigger powershell to execute a .ps1 script that copyies the dlls to output directory (recommended)
        - Check `LabDemos` project to see an example
    - Or: add `xcopy` command to copy the dlls to output directory
        - Check `LegacyDemo.Yuck` project to see an example
